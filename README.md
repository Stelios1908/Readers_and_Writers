# Readers_and_Writers
parallel proc

is a program that solves the problem of readers and writers using semaphores,

in order to avoid prolonged deprivation. That is, if there is a desire for both subscribers

and readers to access the database at the same time, they will access it alternately, one by one,

for example, first a reader, then a subscriber, then again a reader, etc. .K.
